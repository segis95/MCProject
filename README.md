### Calculate Barrier Swaption by Monte-Carlo method
Don't need to do anything, just go into the directory of Swaption then type the compilation command
Compilation command : 
g++ -I. -o swap.out *.cpp

You will find three files written by us:

swap_utils.h : head file 

swap_utils.cpp : all functions need for the Barrier Swaption

test_swap.cpp : main function for the Barrier Swaption


The code print out the price and runing time at the terminal screen.
As output, you are going the expect a file which stores the exit time and the result of each simulation per discretization step.
